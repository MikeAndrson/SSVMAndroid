# SSVMAndroid
[SSVM](https://github.com/xxDark/SSVM) but on Android basically. Uses an `rt.jar` from OpenJDK8 to load boot classes (_8u262-b10-linux-x64_ to be exact). 

JIT works by running D8 on the bytecode generated by [JitCompiler](https://github.com/xxDark/SSVM/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/xdark/ssvm/jit/JitCompiler.java), then the resulting DEX is loaded using an `InMemoryDexClassLoader`.
